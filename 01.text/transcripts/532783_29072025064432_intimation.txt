On behalf of the management, I welcome you all to Q1 Financial Year 26 earnings conference call of LT Foods. Please note that any statement made or discussed during this call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which could be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be reviewed in conjunction with the rest that the company faces. A detailed disclaimer in this regard has been included in the investor presentation that has been shared on both the stock exchanges, i.e., NSE and BSE. The result documents are available on the company's website as well as the stock exchanges. A transcript of this call will also be made available on the investor section of the company's website. So, Q1 update. During Q1 Financial Year 26, LT Foods reported highest ever quarterly revenue and EBITDA of Rs. 2500, 1 crores and Rs. 302 crores respectively, grew by 20% and 17% respectively, versus Q1 Financial Year 25. The growth in revenue is supported by increasing consumer demand and preference towards our brand and entry into new countries, improved supply chain and availability of our brand and increased household penetration. The company reported EBITDA margin of 12.1% in Q1 Financial Year 26 versus 12.4% in Q1 Financial Year 25. A minor 30-bit dip in the margin is on account of increased investment on the brand. Basmati and other speciality rice segments grew by 18% in this quarter, reinforcing the continued global love for our brand. Due to increasing consumer preference for healthier and sustainable food choices, our organic business reported a remarkable 32% growth in this quarter. The major portion of the growth has been contributed by soya milk. Normalized growth other than soya milk is around 18%. Our organic farmer natural biofoods launched a new facility in Rotterdam to support our global ambitions in July 25. The strategically positioned facility and Europe Gateway Port handles 15,000 metric tons annually, positioning us to capture more of the EU $45 billion organic market. In India, the household reach of Davos has grown significantly from 45.56 lakh homes in March 2023 to 56.2 lakh homes in March 2025. This growth was possible due to our constant efforts on innovations, continuous investment on the brand, and staying relevant to evolving consumer needs and ensuring that our products are easily accessible across the globe. The snacking segment and the sabji tari has grown 40% versus last year. We have also acquired rest of 45% of the golden star, which we have completed in late 2025. We now proudly lead as the number one jasmine rice brand in the US. During the quarter, we reinforced ISED bill through the spectacular fourth round of world biryani day celebration in Jaipur and Indore. This celebration cements our position as a global thought bearer of biryani. I would like to now give an update on the geographies. The European continental currently contributes around 18% of our overall revenue. Our progress in this region has been robust, achieving a 57% year-on-year growth. Notably, we have recently secured partnerships with four leading UK retailers, strengthening our footprint in this market. The surge in the revenue is majorly attributed to the UK plant being fully operational in the past quarter. North America, that accounts for 43% of our revenue and continues to be a key growth driver with a 32% year-on-year increase. This includes a consolidation for the jasmine rice business for the quarter as well. The normalized growth of this geography is around 18%. Our flagship brand Royal holds a dominant position, commanding a 54% share in the Pakistani rice import individually. India contributes to 31% of our revenue, recording a 10% year-on-year growth. Our brands collectively hold a 25% market share with category leadership in the western region. Similarly, MS of the world contributes to the remaining 8% of our revenue. We remain optimistic about scaling our presence in this geography by further strengthening the consumer mindset and market penetration. LT Foods' well-diversified geographical presence serves as an effective risk-reduced strategy, reducing dependency on any stable market and enabling consistent performance across varying macroeconomic factors. There's an update on the CVD side with reference to the CVD notice that we received by our fellow subsidiary. The company has filed a phase brief on July 16, 2025, given the past precedence wherein the AFA applied by the department was not held right by the courts of international trade. And as for the process, U.S. top had some questions on verification they could have done as per process by asking for a supplement questionnaire. The grifters have also filed a phase brief and ECO Bureau has also filed a repitance brief on July 24 to contest the ASA. If the DOC finally results maintain ASA, ECO Bureau can file an appeal to the courts of international trade as well. I'll just update you on the industry side as well. India is the largest producer and exporter of basmati rice, contributing approximately 90% of the global supply. The food production regions include Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh. Annual basmati rice production in India stands at 10 million metric tons, of which 6 million metric tons is exported with the remaining consumed in India. Within India, 70% of the rice consumption is still in the form of, you know, the whole strategic thing, but we reviewed in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A detailed disclaimer in this regard has been included in the investor presentation that has been shared on both the stock exchanges, i.e., NSE and BSE. The result documents are available on company's website as well as the stock exchanges. A transcript of this call will also be made available on the investor section of the company's website.

We have got that money against bank guarantee.
Okay.
That is there, and we have a full amount
that is sitting in my books.
Yes, it is backed by bank guarantee,
so we have taken a FDR against the thing.
So the money is there.
Now it is in the high court for the final decision.
So hopefully, you know, the money is there.
Okay, wonderful.
All the best.
Thank you, sir.
The next question is from the line of Ishan.
I hope you know you have got the answer.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
The next question is from the line of Ishan
from Anshika Institutional Equities.
Please go ahead.
Hello, am I audible?
Yes, sir.
Please go ahead.
So congratulations on a good set of numbers.
Could you please share the current inventory level
as of June 30th for both paddy and rice
by volumes and value terms?
So the revenue, the inventory in my books of accounts
is 2,85,000 tons of paddy at an average rate of 29
and 3,00,000 tons of rice at an average rate of 51.
Okay.
And so with the monsoon progressing well,
how do you pay rice price trending
in the second half of FY26?
Ishan, now the crop is going on.
And we are expecting, you know, good crop.
And the expected opening price, it depends, you know,
how the crop performs.
But we expect that from last year, you know,
it will be roughly higher by, you know, 8 to 10% average.
Okay.
On the revenue.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
Thank you, sir.
The next question is from the line of Vipul Kumar
from Stumangal Investments.
Please go ahead.
Hi, thanks for the opportunity
and congrats for a very good set of numbers.
So my first question is,
why is this RTH and RTC segment revenue has degrown,
although base is very small
and at what level of annual sales
this segment will break even at EBITDA level?
Yes, this year, what has happened in RTH and RTC segment,
there was discontinued one of my,
one of the product I discontinued in this category,
that we had launched two years back.
So we discontinued this in the last quarter,
last year quarter.
So it had a revenue share.
So that we lost.
So otherwise everything is as per the plan
and as per the targets.
And yes, this segment will break even
in the EBITDA category once it crosses the 350 crore mark
and which we expect in three years, two to three years back.
The ready to eat and ready to cook is growing.
In USA also we are done with the capacity,
we are building new capacity,
the plant will be operated in the next two, three months.
So then that will start giving us a next level of growth.
On this new product we have launched in India,
which is biryani rice,
now we have launched five curry rice cake.
So that we are getting promising result on that.
Even on the rice cracker side, the snacking side,
we are seeing good initiatives.
So hopefully as your question,
in the next two years we will be on the bridge.
In USA we are already making money on EBITDA level
as far as RTH is concerned.
It is only the India where we are investing
in rice cracker and this ready to cook
or ready to eat segment we are trying to build up.
Okay, and so my second question,
why is our revenue from Middle East region is so low
when the market size as per your presentation
is so huge, 40,000 crores.
So is there any culture issue
or the product mix are different?
So how should one look at this?
I think that's an opportunity for us.
As explained earlier also,
given focusing on the other markets,
for the last three years,
we have started focusing in India and our Middle East.
Although that's a very mature market,
very high entry barriers,
but we will deliver as per the guidance given in five years.
The Saudi has also been well,
but very mature, very high entry barriers market.
So what are the entry barriers?
Can you elaborate please a little bit?
Like any consumer business entry barriers
are the brand and the distribution.
That's what the entry barriers are.
We as per the guidance given,
we have strategies to grow our business,
but that will be a slow one.
Okay, I would drop you a mail,
but I want quantity and value of all regions.
I ask this in every poll and we are-
Aap laliye.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, sir, thank you and all the best.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen,
to ask a question, please press star and one now.
Participants who wish to ask questions
may please press star and one at this time.
The next question is from the line of Krishan Chheda
and retail investor, please go ahead.
Hi, thank you for the opportunity.
My question is this one,
2124 crores of the revenue
that we have received in the basmati
and specialty segment in this quarter.
Could you break that into how much is basmati
and how much is non-basmati please?
I think that is-
I think that is-
Yeah, I'm saying 2124 crores of revenue
that we have clocked in this quarter
in basmati and specialty rice category.
How much is basmati and how much is non-basmati?
First of all, let me tell you what specialty rice is.
One is basmati, other is jasmine.
And that's mainly two varieties.
And 85% of my overall revenue,
85% revenue comes in the specialty.
And yes, there is certain regional rice
that we sell in the India and as well as the exports.
So overall, revenue size in the basmati,
in the basmati and specialty category,
85% is basmati, 15% is the other.
Okay, so 85%?
Sorry, sorry, are you to interrupt?
85% of 2124 number, right?
Yes, yes.
Okay, okay.
Yes, sir, please go ahead, sir, you're saying something.
No, I'm saying mainly basmati,
followed by jasmine and followed by-
Regional rice.
Regional rice.
Right, and one more clarification.
So whatever basmati we sell,
everything is sourced from India
or do we source it from some other geography
business outside India, specifically for basmati?
Mainly India, sometimes from Pakistan,
but this is mainly-
Okay.
Our new operations, they source from Pakistan,
but it depends on year to year.
But this year, it's only less than 10%.
Sure, sure.
Thank you, thank you for that.
And the other question I have is in terms of the future growth plans
that we have shared in the presentation,
I see that it was, you've mentioned the EBITDA will grow at a CAGR of 16%
whereas the PAG will grow at a CAGR of 21%.
So could you help me understand what will change between EBITDA and PAG
that will help us grow PAG faster than the EBITDA?
So yes, it is normal, normal.
Whatever the EBITDA grows, the PAG normally grows at a faster pace.
In considering any kind of industry, anyone.
So yes, there are the interest and application components
which doesn't grow in the same proportion as the growth in the EBITDA percentage.
So our PAG, what we are expecting is a growth,
then a greater growth than what we are expecting in the EBITDA.
But more to add to it, but we are focusing more on the ROC
that we project to have a 23% plus in going forward years.
So from 21 levels, we expect us to grow over 23 plus levels.
Okay, thanks, thank you so much.
Those are my questions.
Wish you all the best.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
The next question is from the line of Praveena Chaudhary
from DM Financials Family Office.
Please go ahead.
Yeah, hi, just a couple of follow-ups.
One is you said that the consolidated normalized growth
adjusting for the Golden Star acquisition was 17%.
But if I just look at your numbers,
I think Golden Star in this quarter would have been around 300 crores, right?
So that month, as stated, it got consolidated in 31st May.
So after that, the revenue was getting consolidated.
So before the revenue was there, yes.
So there is a only one month change was there.
Understood.
And secondly, I'm still not able to wrap my head around this Europe 57% growth, right?
Because Europe would be almost, it must be around 400, 450 crores quarterly revenue rate.
And even if 60 crores had come from UK facility, even then that 57% of the state for the 60 crores
also looks like a very high number.
So yes, the European sales in this quarter, if you include the Europe, the UK advance,
that was 376 crores in the rise in the specialty segment.
Last year it was 239 crores.
The incremental UK sales this year contributed almost 80 crores.
So if we normalize that also, there is a 24% revenue growth that came in the European operations this year.
And what's driving this growth?
So growth is a mix of towers, which is growing.
Second is we have done little bit, you know, B2B sales.
And third is the private label we pack for the stores.
So all three level, you know, growth has been done.
All right.
All right.
But it's not coming more from a private label, right?
It's coming usually from brand mix.
All three revenue drivers, brand, the kind
Because it seems like it was contributing quite significantly on a segmental level. Yes, we pushed it very strongly. We invested money, we put in our whole distribution. But it has not worked as per our expectation. Thank you and all the best. Thank you, sir. This was the last question for the day. I now hand the conference over to the Monika Ma'am for closing comments. Thank you. On behalf of the management of Antifoods, thank you all for joining us on our earnings conference call today. We hope we have been able to address the majority of your queries. The nature of our business and the operating segments of the geophysical market don't deliver highly dynamic parts of variation. So making semi-annual reporting slightly more aligned with our operational rhythm and better position to deliver the meaningful comprehensive insight to our investors. So thus starting from Q2 financial year 26, we will conduct our earnings call semi-annually. In the meanwhile, you may reach out to me or our investor relations partner EY for any further queries that you may have and they will connect with you offline. We now close the call. Thank you all.
