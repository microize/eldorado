Good afternoon sir. What is the guidance for the future this year? Good afternoon. We had guided for 30% increase over last financial year. And we have the expectation that we will grow towards 10% growth in the subsequent year. Okay. We have seen that we have been buying the land from previous years like you mentioned about the market of projects you said to the total size is much higher and the projects have been launched very fast and they are still in the different development. Can you give context to what are the major changes that have happened for 3-4 years in Shilpa in terms of your strategy and according to the paper of the time? No, it's not just about the last 3-4 years. We have been at it in terms of the overall operations for past 3 decades. In 2023 we are completing 30 years this year. We did focus on two things which is like you mentioned the new project launches and making sure that the timeline of the launches from the time we obtained the land is very critical and that's some area where we need to work in a detailed manner internally. So that's something we have clearly focused upon and there is a team which is formed to coordinate this and that has helped us in accelerating some of our project launches. That's one. Second, even in terms of business development we have been at it in few locations like in Greater Noida where we have been able to open value for the land in the number of last year and we have launched the project in June. So that's been a very big turnaround for us and that's very heartening to see. While it is happening in some other cities it's not as a periodic and we still mainly due to the external factors we are continuing to improve in those cities as well. Okay. For today will you be launching here? For today it's a very large project and we are for phase one we are mostly done with the land consolidation and
and we should sign on the project.
So we should start the working towards approval
from in terms of we started working on approvals
from this month.
Depending on the entire timeline of the approvals,
we should be able to launch it in the next one year.
What I quotation is, it can happen earlier, it might.
So basically, if there's 50 crores revenue
you're gonna recognize this year,
which is a box number 50 crores, right?
So then moving forward, whatever project you have launched
in last few years, 50% CBD is the normal
the project level, the project level, 50% CBD?
Yes, 50 crores, what I mentioned was CBD.
The second way is for all the new projects
that we have been selling in the past, say, three years,
we have carried last time that we had
at the project level, we are recognizing it at 50%.
And congratulations, Mr. Manani,
and I will make sure that it is fine and consistent.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
The next question is from the line of Paramesh Karki
from Bulama Group. Please proceed.
Hi. Really long for the genuine questions and congrats for the good seven numbers. A couple of questions from my side. Of course, when we talk about this potential non-sale of 8 to 9 million square feet, does it include the launches that we've already done in 2.1 or does it exclude it?
So we are hoping that we'll do another 8 million square feet in the next month.
And what will be the total potential of 8 million square feet over the three quarters?
Well, the total value of the project as an average of at least 12,000 should be about close to 10,000 crores. How much of that is going to translate into sales depending on the timeline of the project. But overall, we expect that we should be doing roughly about 50% of our sales from new launches in this year and 50% from the earlier 8 million square feet.
Which is pretty much similar to what we did in 2.1, right? About 1,000 odd crores from new launches and 1,000 crores for 8.6.
Absolutely. You're right. And lastly, in terms of the ticket size of the project that we are launching, I mean, if one looks at 2.1, clearly roughly about 60 odd percent was from ticket size less than 3 crores and about 40% above 3 crores. So for the upcoming 8 million square feet of launches, will these margins be the same or will it be slightly different?
So last year, around this time, we had a much larger sale value through a much higher ticket size because of the launches of high ticket size projects that have come together. And as being the same website, it was no strategic call that we have taken, just that the timing of all of those projects have come together. But otherwise, all our projects, our bread and butter business has been largely between within 18,000 to 50,000 square feet. And this is a roughly about ticket size between 2 to 3 crores. However, some of the projects and also some of the inventory in some of these projects would be over that ticket size as well. So it's going to be a mix of both, but tilted towards less than 3 crores. Yeah. I will digest it. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Himanshu Upadhyay from JioGanjuak, USA. Hi, good afternoon. My first question was, can you give me a heart from business? Are there any heart from its market are most attractive markets in terms of distance between sales and costs of land currently in our market? Where do you find the least favorable markets in terms of profitability in the next 4 to 5 years? Some of our costs will be there.
Thank you, Himanshu. That's a strategic question which probably I may not be elaborating much. But what we can say is for us, the first markets are where we currently in our current operations is Bangalore, of course, second is NCR. In addition to these two, these would be long term, we would look at Mumbai as well. However, we have just started here. So these three are, as you know, are very large markets in India. In addition to this, of course, our presence in Hyderabad and Hyderabad and Pune are also there. So they will continue to be our areas where you should find very opportunistic plans when we would look at investments. From a high return on investment issue, according to our reading, then still Bangalore is a good market. NCR also is a good market. Mumbai, we are still catching up. So our understanding is limited. And as we continue to look at opportunities and invest there, we'll know the market better. So from our current markets right now, these both seem to be good, both in terms of return and in terms of the demand potential and our own presence. So they make the most strategic sense for us in opening this year. And then there is a presence in other locations. And if we get something which is great on return margin, we will definitely take it up.
And one question on this Mumbai project. We have launched a very small project, a planned acquisition of it. And what is the thought process? Are we getting into a new market, a very small project, and then we finalize the micro market and then we launch a bigger project? Or it was just a happen that we have started with a small project? Is it a strategy that we are just doing a small project? Some parts come back to the red for you. However, we have been evaluating the various sites and sizes of the project. And we have been doing this for the past more than a year. And it depends on the site at which we have our capital availability also. So at that point of time, which way we have this and some of the others that we are evaluating and in advanced stages, there are two factors that we will consider. One is the size of the opportunity and the quality of opportunity. And second is our own ability to fund it. So both these matter. Now that we have slightly better capital structure in which we can evaluate opportunities, we should be looking at larger ones. But more importantly for us, the first one is very critical because our own understanding of the market and going through the entire process of acquisition to launch and completion is very critical so that we will have significant learnings from it and take it forward from there. So we are in the market for a very long term and Mumbai is a very large market and hence we are in the path on exploratory nature right now. And as and when we find good opportunities, we will be willing to take it up.
Just a follow up on this. When we do this 150,000 square one type of project, 150 types of plants, can we even show our all types of what we can do in such a small piece of land? Do you think you will be able to create a brand what we have in Bengaluru and Jaipur who did a smaller project? Overall, this is a good question. My question is that in this particular project, this is phase one of the project, practically the total size of the project is over 300,000 square feet. So the second part is regarding the scale of the project. Yes, we would definitely like to do projects which are larger in nature. However, I think considering the nature of land and kind of opportunities that are present in Mumbai, particularly in the core Mumbai area, it is very difficult to start with a much larger development potential. So hence, even this is a, I'm believing that this is a good start. We'll be able to showcase our quality even in this project. However, in fact, I'm stressing that it will take time. However, since the brand is well recognized, we do think that the understanding of our brand and our processes there, people do understand that and should be able to be moving towards that and giving it back. So it might be a small step, but at the same time, we are continuously evaluating new opportunities.
Thanks, sir. Thank you for your question.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Johan Bhakiyawa from Motilal Oswal. Please proceed.
Hi, Johan. Thank you, sir.
Yes, Johan.
Thank you, sir. First question is on the earlier comment on the project level EBITDA margin. You said it would be probably closer to around 75%. This was 50% impression on that one. What is the margin that is targeted for 170 billion? And also, on overall perspective, what will be the margin excluding overheads and interest?
Well, Johan, that's a slightly tricky question because the timing of recognition of the revenue plays a significant role in terms of arriving on that project level EBITDA to that margin for the company because there are various overheads that come in which are nice, even the borders, and they will be timing of the revenue and what quantum of that timing matters a lot. And hence, it's very difficult to give fairly fair amount to that. But what we can clearly say is that as we go forward, the core EBITDA margins that we have seen at the project level, which were in the past, have definitely are increasing, are seen to increase. And hence, overall, our cash margins also should keep increasing.
Okay. And my second question is on the OCS. I think in the last quarter call, when you guided at 10% in DPA for FY23, does that still hold good?
In terms of operating cash flow?
Yes.
For the full year?
For the full year, yes. I mean, we will still be on track for
Thank you. Due to time constraints, that was the last question for the day. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Over to you, sir.

Thank you. Thank you everyone for participating on behalf of me and my family. We really appreciate that. We hope that we have answered most of your questions. In case we could not, please send comments to our investor relations representative. As I mentioned earlier in my opening comments, we are looking at a good center in terms of business demand environment and we are also getting good talent around our area. And we have a sufficient team in terms of getting into the project and consulting here. And this is just the theme that is the current financial structure and the theme kind of design that we see today is an opportune time for us to have a very long-term growth. And we continue to invest in opportunity, people's processes and technology to enable this long-term growth. Thank you everyone for participating and have a good day.
On behalf of ICICI Securities Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.
