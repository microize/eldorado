Good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations on the excellent performance. My first question is on the stated launch pipeline for the remaining of the year. You mentioned around 78 million square feet. So, just wanted to understand, are we planning to launch the entire 78 million square feet or, you know, A10 launch 78 million square feet, but open this part of each project? Also, I didn't hear Mumbai project. So, is Mumbai project part of the pipeline? And then my first question. Yeah, the project on Mumbai project, yes, it is part of the pipeline project. To the earlier question, I was answering for the major large projects that we can launch. So, Mumbai's first stage is a smaller one. It's about 100 million square feet or 150,000 square feet to start with. So, hence, I didn't add in the pipeline, but it's surely part of that. Coming to the other 8-9 million square feet, the definition of our launch of a project is once we obtain data, and we obtain the sale for the market, irrespective of the size of the project, we say that the benefit can be given on the entire inventory. So, at the end of the day, we have obtained data, we declare as launched. But given the nature of the launches this year, majority of them are not very large projects, and hence, we should be able to open up the entire inventory for most projects. So, if I have to say that about 18 million square feet, I think 70-80% of it should be able to open. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the clarification. No problem. Just to clarify, I'm sorry, I'm on the process of making a call. That's okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hello? Can you hear me? No, sir, your voice is breaking. Can you please repeat the question, please? I can't hear from the... Can you hear me from the... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Manoj, can you repeat? No, I'm sorry. Can you hear me, sir? Could you please repeat your question? Yes. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manoj Jaiswal from Geometrics, please proceed. Good afternoon, sir. What is the guidance for this year? Good afternoon, Manoj. We had guided for 30% degree over the last financial year. And we are hoping to do about 10,000 crore sales in the subsequent year. Okay. And secondly, we have a consistent trend where the amount of project you sell after the total size of the higher and the projects have been launched very fast and they are in the different development. Can you give context to what are the major changes that have happened for 3-4 years in Shobha in terms of your strategy and according to the data that you have? Well, Manoj, it's not just about this last 3-4 years. We have been, I think, in terms of the overall operations for the last 3 decades. In fact, we are completing 30 years this year. The big focus on two things, which is like you mentioned, the new project launches and making sure that the timeline of the launches from the time we obtain the land is very critical and that's some area where we need to work in an integrated manner internally. So that's something we have clearly focused upon and there is a team which is formed to coordinate this and that has helped us in accelerating some of our project launches. That's one. Second, even in terms of business development, we have been actually in few locations, like in Greater Noida, where we had that we are able to open value for the land in the number of last year and we launched the project in June. So that's been a very quick turnaround for us and that's very happy to see. While it is happening in some other cities, it's not as a priority to get a picture on, which is mainly due to the external factors. We are continuing to improve in those cities as well. Okay. What would be the launch this year? Of course, it is a very large project and we are, for phase one, we are mostly trying to get our land consolidation
and in the brand. So we should start working towards approvals from the sense that we started working on approvals from this month. Depending on the entire timeline of the approvals, we should be able to launch it in the next one year, is what our expectation is. It can happen earlier.
If we go by the execution of what is the recognized decision, we can go by the execution of that. So going forward, whatever projects we have launched in our QCIS, 20% CBB we are saying most of the projects will be project level, 20% CBB? Yes, 20% CBB we are mentioning as CBB. The secondary, all the new projects that we have been selling in the past say three years, we have realized last time that we were at the project level, we had a maximum CBB percent. Okay, so that is 2019, it will make the 5% execution of the project. Thank you.
The next question is from the line of Parveen Kaji from Durama Group. Please proceed. Hi, really long for the genuine question and congrats for the results on the numbers. A couple of questions from my side. Of course, when we talk about this potential launch of 8 to 9 million square feet, does it include the launches that you have already done in Q1 or does it exclude it? It excludes it. So we are hoping that we will do another 8 million square feet in the next month. And what will be the total potential of 8 million square feet over the three quarters? Well, the total value of the project as an average of at least 12,000 should be about close to 10,000 crores. How much of that is going to translate into sales depending on the timeline of the launches of the project. But overall, we expect that we should be doing roughly about 50% of our sales from new launches in this year and 50% from the earlier projects that we have. Which is very much similar to what we did in Q1, right? About 1,000 crores from new launches and 1,000 crores from existing projects. Absolutely, you're right. And lastly, in terms of the ticket size of the projects that we are launching, I mean, if one looks at Q1, clearly roughly about 60-odd percent was from ticket sizes less than 3 crores and about 40% above 3 crores. So for the upcoming 8 million square feet of launches, will we broadly see the same or will it be slightly different? Okay, sir. Last year, around this time, we had a much larger sale value through higher ticket size because of the launches of high ticket size projects that have come together. And it has been the same despite it was no strategic call that we have taken. It's just that the timing of all of those projects have come together. But otherwise, all our projects, our bread and butter business has been largely between the range of 100 to 2,000 square feet. And this is roughly about ticket size between 2 to 3 crores. However, some of the projects would be, some of the projects and also some of the inventory in some of these projects would be over that ticket size as well. So it's going to be a mix of both, but tilted towards less than 3 crores. I understand. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, sir. The next question is from the line of Himanshu Upadhyay from Jubilant Usha. Please proceed. Hi. Good afternoon. My first question was, can you give me apart from business, any apart from its markets are most attractive markets in terms of, in terms of the sales there and cost of land currently in the market and where you find the least favorable markets in terms of property that you are in next four to five years. Some of your thoughts would be there. Thank you, Himanshu. That's a strategic question, which probably I'm not elaborating much. But what I, what we can say is for us, the current markets are very deterrent in our current operations in Bangalore. Of course, second is NCR. In addition to these two, we would be, in the long term, we would look at Mumbai as well. However, we have just started here. So these three are, as you know, are very large markets in India. In addition to this, of course, our presence in Hyderabad and Hyderabad, Chennai and Pune are also there. So they would continue to be our areas where, if you find very opportunity plans, then we would look at investments. From a, from a high return on investment, if you would, according to the reading group, then still Bangalore is a good market. NCR also is a good market. Mumbai, we are still getting our current business limited. And as we continue to look at opportunities and invest there, we will have a market there as well. So from our current markets right now, these both seem to be good, both in terms of return and in terms of the demand potentials and our own presence. So they make the most strategic sense for us in over the coming years. And then we'll have a presence in other locations. And if we get something which is great on return margins, we'll definitely look at that. One question was Mumbai. You have launched a very small project or a planned acquisition of it. And what is the thought process? Are you focusing on a medium market with a specific small project and then you finalize a micro market and then we launch a specific project? Or it was just, it happened that we started with a small project, but is it a strategy that you are just doing a small project? Some parts from that will be helpful for me. However, we have been evaluating the various size and size of the project. And we have been doing this for the past more than a year. It depends on the size at which we have our appetite available with the offer. So at that point of time, which we have done this and some of the others that we are evaluating and in advanced stages, there are two factors that we will consider. One is the size of the opportunity and the quality of the opportunity. And second is our own ability to fund it. So both these matter. Now that we have slightly better capital structure in which we can evaluate opportunities, we should be looking at larger ones. But more importantly for us, the first one is very critical because our own understanding of the market and going through the entire process of acquisition to launch and completion is very critical. So that we will have significant learnings from it and take it forward from there. So we are in the market for a very long term and hence, and Mumbai is a very large market and hence we are on a path of exploratory nature right now. And as and when we find good opportunities, we will be willing to take it up. Just a follow up on this. When you do this 1,50,000 square feet type of project, 150 type of plans, can we even show all types of what we can do in such a small piece of land? You think you will be able to create a brand what we have in Bangalore, Bengaluru? Will it be a good success in this small piece of land? In this particular project, it is phase one of the project. Practically the total size of the project is over 300,000 square feet. So the second part is regarding the scale of the project. Yes, we would definitely like to do projects which are larger in nature. However, I think considering the nature of land and kind of opportunities that are present in Mumbai, particularly in the core Mumbai area, so it is very difficult to start with a much larger development potential. Hence, even this is a good start. We will be able to showcase our quality even in this project. But that, in fact, from subsidization for the customer would take time. However, since the brand is well recognized, we do think that the understanding of our brand and our processes there will go to do and we should be able to be moving towards that and giving it back. So it might be a small step, but at the same time, we are continuously evaluating new opportunities. Thanks for the program. Thank you. Hi, sir. The next question is from the line of Johan Bhattiwala from Motilalu's One. Please proceed. Hi, Johan. Yes, sir. Thank you for taking the question. My question is on earlier comments on the project level EBITDA margin. You said it is usually around 30%. This was the case in question on that. Do you believe this? What is the margin that we are targeting for 170 billion? And also, on the overall perspective, what will be the margin excluding overheads and interest? Well, Johan, that's a slightly tricky question because the timing of the recognition of the revenue plays a significant role in terms of arriving from that project level EBITDA to the company level. Because there are various overheads that come in which are right during the quarter. There, the timing of the revenue, when they come in and the quantum of that timing matters a lot. And hence, it's very difficult to get clearly clear on what could be the answer. But what we can clearly say is that as we go forward, the core EBITDA margins that we have seen at the project level, which were in the past, have definitely been increasing. And hence, overall our cash margins also should keep increasing. Okay. And my second question is also earlier, I think in the last quarter call, we had guided 10% in the data by 170 billion. Does that still hold good? In terms of operating cash flow? Yes, yes. For the full year? For the full year, yes. I mean, we would still be on track for that. Overall with the increase in our sales value and the funding, the milestone payments
Thank you. Due to time constraints, that was the last question for the day. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Over to you, sir.

Thank you. Thank you everyone for participating on our team and my colleagues. We really appreciate that. We hope that we have answered most of your questions. In case we do not, please send any team to our investor relations representative. As I mentioned earlier in my opening comments, we are looking at a good trend in terms of agile demand environment and we are fully prepared to stand out along our curve. And we have a exceptional team in terms of delivering quality across India. And there is just the ease that is the current financial structure and with the kind of design that we have in this space, it's an opportune time for us to have a very long term growth. And we continue to invest in opportunity, people, processes and technology to enable this long term growth. Thank you everyone for participating and have a good evening.
On behalf of ICICI Securities Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your line.
