Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to IDFC First Bank Q1 FY26 Earnings Conference. As a reminder, all participants will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zero on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Subhashish Pawar, Head Investor Relations. Thank you and over to you, sir. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone, for joining this call on Saturday evening. Today we have with us V. V. Raghunathan, MD and CEO of the bank, and Sudhanshu Jain, our CFO. We will have some brief from Sudhanshu first on the results, followed by comments from Vidya. So now after that, we will open the session for Q&A. So right now, I'll hand over the call to Sudhanshu for his speech. Yeah, thank you, Subhashish. First of all, very good evening, everyone. I also again thank everyone for joining on an late evening on Saturday. I'll try to set up on the two financial numbers for the quarter. Maybe I'll start with the balance sheet component and then move to asset quality, TNA, capital and liquidity in that order. I'll try to quickly brief. Maybe start with balance sheet size, that stood at about 3.6 lakh crores as June 30, 2025, 25, sorry, and withdrew at about 18% on a YY basis. If we now see for the components, then we continue to see a strong growth on the deposit side. Our customer deposit in fact crossed the 2.5 lakh crore milestone and was at 2.57 lakh crores in June. Similarly, retail deposit crossed 2 lakh crore mark. The growth in customer deposits was very strong at 26% on a YY basis. If we talk about the CASA ratio, that also improved sequentially and touched 48% at June. The CASA deposit in balance terms grew strongly at about 30% on a YY basis. Even on an average basis, we saw a similar growth on Q1. Term deposits on the other hand was also grew strongly at 21% on a YY basis. If we see term deposit, which is retail term deposit and CASA deposit put together, they are now 85% of our customer deposits. During the quarter, we added 14 more branches and that takes the branch count to now 1,050. We also repaid high-cost legacy warrants of Rs. 2,640 crores in the current quarter. Happy to report that the residual stock is just now Rs. 2,200 crores and majority will mature in the previous quarter. We continue to bring down the legacy deposit ratio that is now down to 93.4% at June 25. This was at 98.1% in June of last year. In fact, retail deposit ratio for the last one year is at 75.8%. As a listed point, the cost of funds for the quarter was at 6.42% and this declined by about 9 basis points in the quarter. Similarly, cost of deposits for the quarter was at 6.37% and this declined marginally by 1 basis point in the previous quarter. You would have noticed that we have drastically reduced the TCA in the previous quarter as compared to last quarter. This could reflect by way of lower cost of funds with some lag in the ensuing quarter. On the asset side, the funded assets registered a strong growth of 21% on a YOI basis to reach 2.53 lakh crores. Sequentially, the growth was about 4.7%. The growth in the asset segment was largely led by segments like mortgages, bridgers, business banking, working capital loans and wholesale growth. If we go to the presentation, we have given a detailed breakup inside copy in the presentation. Wholesale book grew at a faster rate at 39% on a YOI basis and the growth was about 34% on an average basis at June on a YOI basis. Non-fund book similarly grew by 25% on a YOI basis. We have given some more colors on the corporate funded and non-funded book inside 38 of the presentation. Very briefly, about 77% of the corporate book is rated at Q1 above and 90% is rated triple B. We continue to also scale up products like credit card, gold loans, education loans which are increasing from a smaller base. We have now issued 3.8 million credit cards. The spend on the credit card was quite healthy and it grew by over 35% on a YOI basis. During the quarter, we also had a degrowth of 37% YOI in the microfinance business because of the challenges which we have been seeing around this sector. MFI book is now at rupees 849 crore and a 3.3% underfunded book. I will talk about SMA, collection efficiency and some of these parameters on MFI slightly later on. If I talk about asset quality, gross NPS of the bank increased marginally from 1.87% to 1.97% in June. Net NPS for the same year increased from 0.52% in March to 0.55% for June quarter. Excluding the microfinance book, GNPAs ratio remained broadly stable from 1.63% in March to 1.7% in June at the bank level. Provision coverage for the bank continues to be quite healthy at about 72-73%. Net has in fact improved by about 298 basis points on a YOI basis. If I talk about GNPAs and NPA movement in the MSME segment, that stood at 1.82% and increased from 1.70% in March quarter. Net NPAs similarly increased to 0.66% and was higher by about 4 basis points in the previous quarter. Excluding microfinance, GNPA for retail, rural and MSME segments stood at 1.48% in the June quarter. The standard restructuring book continues to come down. It is a very small component at about 0.7% of the funded assets and we feel it's actually provided. If I talk about the SMA 1 and 2 pool of retail, rural and MSME book at June, that increased from 1.07% in March to about 1.01%. The decline was largely because of reduction in SMA 1 and 2 of the MFI book. That came down from 5.1% to 2.64% in June. In absolute terms, MFI SNA pool was at Rs. 315 crore in June 25 and this is declined at 60% post-keeping of the December quarter. We have also seen an improvement in collection efficiency for MFI during the quarter which stood at 99.0% as against 98.1% in the previous quarter. On a prudent basis, we continue to hold the contingency provision of Rs. 3,000 crore on the SMA book and hence no utilization was done during the current quarter. If I talk about gross returns for the quarter, that increased sequentially by 14% from Rs. 215 crore in Q4 to Rs. 248 crore in current quarter. We have called out that this included about Rs. 108 crore pertaining to one previous public provider company which has been recognized as NP during the current quarter. We have also made 100% provision on this particular case. The gross return for MFI business decreased from Rs. 5712 crore in Q4 to Rs. 514 crore in Q1. The SMA pool size had come down significantly and also reflected to lower SMA 0 at least in Q3. We expect provisions to significantly come down in Q2 on the MFI front. Gross return ratio during the quarter excluding microfinance stood at 3.54% which was marginally higher than 3.35% which we had on an average in March 4 quarters put together. We expect this to improve from here on. Moving on to profitability, let me start with NII. That grew at 5.1% on a YOI basis to Rs. 4933 crore for Q1. Excluding MFI, and excluding MFI because that book has been coming down. Excluding MFI, NII grew by about 11.8% on a YOI basis. The net interest margin areas for the quarter moderated by 20 basis points to 5.71% and the decrease was I would say attributed to many components. Of course there was faster repo which happened on the applicable book. There has been a decline in the microfinance business and the fact that we have scaled up wholesale business and also there was moderation in the investment yield as the rates came down. This was often to some extent by the reduction in the cost of funds. The decline in NIM as I mentioned earlier at 20 basis in fact would be 17 basis if you simply annualize the increase of months for both Q4 and Q1. Moving on to free and other income for the quarter, that increased by 8.5% on a YOI basis from 1695 crore to Rs 1735 crore in Q1 of this year. The retail fee constitute most of it and that is 91% of the total fee. Again if you exclude MFI business then NIM fee and other income put together grew by about 12.2% for the quarter on a YOI basis. We continue to moderate on the operating expenses front for the quarter growth has moderated to 11% on a YOI basis. Sequentially often declined by 1.4% in value terms. Tailwind growth for the quarter was strong at Rs 4.
...front is required? 

Just one question on... So, the report has just come 7-8 soon. When does that pass-through happen on your EDL book? 

The pass-through rate stands, it will happen in Q2 on the loan card. And I would say, some bit of pass-through transition could happen in Q2. 

No, no, okay. But it doesn't happen for three months or gradually within three months? No, no. When you pass it at five months, generally, say a report gets in a particular month, there is a cycle, say the customers roll their EDLs every three months. So, it depends on when his last loan happens. So, that's how the transition will happen through the quarter. So, hence, we saw some bit of report transition of the February loan card built into Q1. And as I said, because of the three months cycle, some bit of spillover could happen in Q2. So, those would essentially come largely in Q2. So, that's how the report transition will happen. 

Okay, okay. So, the April transition has not fully happened then? Because some months, due date could have come, let's say, on 15th May. So, for that, you have only for half of one. Isn't that correct? Yeah, exactly. Somebody whose last transition was in March would have already got it built into one. Somebody's last reset was, say, JTSA, as you are particularly saying, for him the transition will happen in the next quarter. So, it depends on the cycle when you have sort of availed the loan. And that's as far as the existing loans are concerned. For the new loans, of course, the transition would be immediate and depends from bank to bank in terms of how you want to sort of price the loans in terms of lending. Understood. So, then, just a random question, how easier 5.7% you want to go in the next three quarters to 5.8%. Obviously, Q2 will be lower. How much more do you need to cut our CD rates by to reach that? No, no, you get good credit, yeah. So, that alone is enough to go back to 5.8%. The deposit microgravity pipeline is enough to take us to 5.8%. It will be changed. The capital is also coming up. Oh, so your... Capital cost. Okay, understood. Yeah, that was a combined. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from the line of... Thank you so much. from ISEC. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi, sir. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on asset quality. So, like for the report, it's got some 7% soon. When does the pass-through happen on your EDI's book? The pass-through rate stands, it will happen in Q2 on the loan card. And I would say, some bit of pass-through transition could happen in Q2 on account of the June card.

So, name the orders of family, this is the largest 20% of the industry, but we are not seeing anything like that and we will be holding a number of our decision around in any quarters. In fact, we specifically call up for instance, we collaborate with groups, etc. So, you watch, but you should be comfortable with everything also. Thank you. The next question is from the line of James from IKEJ Securities, please go ahead. Yeah, hi, good evening sir. Sir, I think you gave the CASA numbers together, which is the increase of the single overall growth. If you have the number separately for car and car in detail, for this quarter and maybe YY, just to get an understanding of the growth in car and car separately. Yes, I think so. So, we are only looking at the regular growth in car as well, but the car as a proportion is still smaller for us, right? And that's about 15% of the total car. If you endeavor it to increase this car proportion as you kind of go along. If you see for, players who have been here so long, this ratio is typically higher at about 20-25% right, of car car. Or car as a percentage of the total deposit, maybe about 13-14%. For us, that ratio is around 7.5-8% last time I think. So, we are working to improve the numbers. Yeah. And actually, we are lower if you see on this car percentage, what it should be. Because in the industry, generally people think car is the harder car, but we certainly have seen that we could, because we have good banks that could work, reach a goal and comfort work, we believe that we should be able to get, we are really trying to get the best number of cars. Right, I was trying to understand the car movement in the last, let's say one or two quarters. A lot of banks have cut car rates drastically, right? And we now have a significant advantage over peers in terms of yield, high rate. Has that grown in dynamically in the balances? Because balance is not visible just by looking at the CASA number in total. So, that was the idea to understand, you know, of course, if we are at a stage sacrificing when it comes to cost, are we getting the required, the desired focus? I think we have seen the growth in the car, growth is very strong. So, I think as the management and the team is very, very focused on what is getting right for somebody, right? The combination, it's a bank, it's a tech, the UI, UX, it's a very, very good model. If you don't have the bank, the bank account is a great example. It's a great tech, so it's a model. It's a bit of a stress. So, maybe our public presence in a different way is good. So, there are so many things that are going well outside of growth, seven years ago, because it's a very difficult growth. So, it's very difficult to predict what is working, but something is working, the combo is working somewhere. So, that's why we cut our FD rate. The reason why, you know, the idea is that FD rate more sharply and beautifully is that as in when we cut, you know, let's say that one year goes forward, goes ahead, and our entire fixed deposit balances of say about a lack of crores, let's say it cuts downwards. Okay, recorded by 9000 basis points. Can you imagine what is the perceived benefit to the people of the bank in the subsequent year, in 2023 and 2024? I mean, everyone is going to maintain that FD rate. So, because it's a structural advantage. So, that's why we cut FD rate because you will see the benefit of it in subsequent years because it's a structural thumb down. Besides in our hands, you can cut anything you want. You just want to make sure that there is enough money in the bank. If you pay up all our bonds, we still have to pay the deposit to the bonds, not FD cost, but we're very financing again. So, we pay out everything with this money and we pay people then many of the other bonds. Right. No, so I was just looking at the timing of this, if we want to cut car rates and maybe this is the time, right? I mean, car rates by the peer banks have come down to historical low levels. And so again, but maybe the peer banks are not cut yet. We will accelerate in terms of the zone of a big bank. Can you imagine, let's say a particular peer bank is at 12% and we cut from 20% to 21% and the model is cut both. We have sharply cut the fixed deposit. I mean, it all comes down to the same thing. Everything comes down to the cost of funds. But let's say structuring is cut. Right. And then just on margins, right? So, this quarter, let's say, we are decent 50-55% credit growth. We have done very well in excess of this change. And let's say 15-20 points yield compression, specially resulted in 25-30 points yield reduction, right? Because there is not too much in the cost of funding at all, right? Similarly, since pragmatically Q2, if the remaining 250 points yield income come, then there is no material change in the cost of the bond and maybe the failure in the outcome. Is that a decent mathematics? Yes, yes, of course. You got it right. That's why we pointed out, at least, you know, you could have a situation where you, you know, you don't remember at the beginning of point in time, that we are Q1, Q2, there is both of us, say this, you know, income has come down and cost of funding has come down, you know, proportionately. But here, maybe, capital is because of the thing, looking ahead. And when you look to Q3 or Q4, I think you are not, as I said just a few months ago, 5-8% yield in Q3, right? But Q2, the excess yield income came down. Right. And last question, we are now large bank, I mean, one of the fastest growing. On the board side, just a small observation that we have one executive director, which resembles, you know, some of the small private banks, whereas the large private banks have multiple EDs. So when do you think we would hit that, that the time would come when, you know, we have more than one ED? Thank you. I am finishing for the board, we don't think about this thing at the board, we only think about customer. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chelsea Mowdy from J&T Mowdy, please go ahead. Hi, Ravi, thanks for the call. Definitely, it seems like your asset quality is holding much better than peers on the delivered numbers, but is there any, are there any early warning signs, let's say, three or six months from now, if you do end up getting some sort of weakness, what may be the possible areas that this could lead to slightly higher NPLs, let's say, on the box banking? So what is the material number that you would worry about? I will answer the question accordingly. Would you say five basis points would bother you, would you say 10% you, at what stage would you say that this is a follow-up? 10 basis points? Oh my, then that. 10 basis points. Five zero? Yeah. No, no, we don't think there's anything that we need to worry about at that point. How do you say five basis points, because, you know, if you're a business, and you know, let's say one year goes forward, goes ahead, and our entire fixed deposit balances of say about a lack of crores, let's say it cuts downwards. Okay, recorded by 9000 basis points. Can you imagine what is the perceived benefit to the people of the bank in the subsequent year, in 2023 and 2024? I mean, everyone is going to maintain that FD rate. So because it's a structural advantage. So that's why we cut FD rate because you will see the benefit of it in subsequent years because it's a structural thumb down. Besides in our hands, you can cut anything you want. You just want to make sure that there is enough money in the bank. If you pay up all our bonds, we still have to pay the deposit to the bonds, not FD cost, but we're very financing again. So we pay out everything with this money and we pay people then many of the other bonds. Right. No, so I was just looking at the timing of this, if we want to cut car rates and maybe this is the time, right? I mean, car rates by the peer banks have come down to historical low levels. And so again, but maybe the peer banks are not cut yet. We will accelerate in terms of the zone of a big bank. Can you imagine, let's say a particular peer bank is at 12% and we cut from 20% to 21% and the model is cut both. We have sharply cut the fixed deposit. I mean, it all comes down to the same thing. Everything comes down to the cost of funds. But let's say structuring is cut. Right. And then just on margins, right? So, this quarter, let's say, we are decent 50-55% credit growth. We have done very well in excess of this change. And let's say 15-20 points yield compression, specially resulted in 25-30 points yield reduction, right? Because there is not too much in the cost of funding at all,
