I now hand the conference over to Mr. Subhashish Bhattani, Head Investor Relations. Thank you and over to you, sir.

Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone, for joining this call on Saturday evening. Today we have with us V.P. Radhunathan, MD&CEO of the bank, and Sudhanshu Jain, our CFO. So we have some briefs from Sudhanshu first on the results, followed by comments from Aditya. So now after that we will open the session for Q&A. Right now I'll hand over the call to Sudhanshu for his speech. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Sudhanshu. First of all, good evening, everyone. I also again thank everyone for joining on an 8 a.m. Saturday. I'll try to set up a few financial numbers for the quarter, and maybe I'll start with balance sheet components and then move to asset quality, P&L, capital, and liquidity components. I'll try to keep it brief, and maybe start with balance sheet side. That's stood at about 3.6 lakh across at June 36, 2025, and grew at about 18% on a YOY basis. If we now see for the components, we continue to see a strong growth on the deposit side. Our customer deposit in fact crossed the 2.5 lakh crore milestone and was at 2.57 lakh crore at June. Similarly, retail deposits crossed 2 lakh crore mark. The growth in customer deposits was very strong at 26% on a YOY basis. If we talk about the CASA ratio, that also improved sequentially and touched 48% at June. The CASA deposits in balance of June strongly at about 30% on a YOY basis. Even on an average basis, we saw a similar growth, 41. Term deposits, on the other hand, was also grew strongly at 21% on a YOY basis. If we see these term deposits, this is retail term deposits and CASA deposits put together, they are now 85% of our customer deposits. During the quarter, we added 14 more branches, and that takes the branch count to now 1,050. We also repaid high-cost related borrowings of rupees 2,640 crores in the current quarter. Happy to report that the residual stock is just now rupees 2,200 crores, and majority will mature in the previous quarter. We continue to bring down the related deposit ratio. That is now down to 93.4% at June 25. This was at 98.1% in June of last year. In fact, retail deposit ratio for the last one year is at 75.8%. A financial point, the cost of funds for the quarter was at 6.42% and will decline by about 9% during the quarter. Similarly, cost of deposits for the quarter was at 6.37% and will decline marginally by 1% during the quarter. You would have noticed that we have drastically reduced the BQDA in this quarter as compared to last quarter. This could reflect by a lower cost of funds with some lag in the ensuing quarters. On the asset side, the funded assets registered a strong growth of 21% on a YY basis to reach 2.53 lakh crores. Sequentially, the growth was about 4.7%. The growth in the asset segment was largely led by segments like mortgage, rental, business banking, working capital loans, and wholesale growth. If we go to the presentation, we have given a detailed breakup inside 40 of the presentation. Wholesale book grew at a faster pace at 39% on a YY basis and the growth was about 34% on an average basis at June on a YY basis. Non-fund book similarly grew by 25% on a YY basis. We have given some more color on the corporate funded and non-funded book inside 38 of the presentation. Very briefly, about 70% of the corporate book is rated as Q1 above and 90% is rated Q2B. We continue to also scale up products like credit card, gold loan, education loan, which are increasing from a smaller base. We have now issued 3.8 million credit cards. The spend on the credit card was quite healthy and grew by about 35% on a YY basis. During the quarter, we also had a degrowth of 37% YY in the microfinance business because of the challenges which we have been seeing around this sector. The MFI book is now at rupees 8474 and we have 3.3% on the funded book. I will talk about SMA collection efficiency and some of these parameters on MFI slightly later on. If I talk about asset quality, gross NPA of the bank increased marginally from 1.87% to 1.97% in June. Net NPA correspondingly increased from 0.52% in March to 0.55% for June quarter. Excluding the microfinance book, GNPA rate of increase was from 1.63% in March to 1.7% in June at the bank level. Provision coverage for the bank continues to be quite healthy at about 72.3%. Net price in fact improved by about 208% on a YY basis. If I talk about GNPA and NPA movement in the MSME segment, that stood at 1.82% and increased from 1.70% in March quarter. Net NPA similarly increased to 0.66% and was higher by about 4% from the previous quarter. Excluding microfinance, GNPA for retail, rural and MSME segments stood at 1.48% in the June quarter. The standard restructuring book continues to come down. It is a very small component at about 0.7% of the funded assets and we feel is adequately provided. If I talk about the SMA 1 and 2 pool of retail, rural and MSME book at June, that includes from 1.07% in March to about 1.01%. The decline was largely because of reduction in SMA 1 and 2 of the MFI book. That came down from 5.1% to 2.64% in June. In actual terms, MFI SMA pool was at rupees 315 crores as compared to March and this was declined by 60% in the December quarter. We have also seen an improvement in collection efficiency for MFIs during the quarter which stood at 99.0% as against 98.1% in the previous quarter. On a prudent basis, we continue to hold the contingency provision of rupees 315 crores on the SMA book and hence no utilization was done during the current quarter. If I talk about gross reversals for the quarter, that increased sequentially by 14% from rupees 215 crores in Q4 to 248 crores in the current quarter. We have found out that this included about 108 crores pertaining to one prepaid service provider company which has been recognized as NPA during the current quarter. We have also made 100% provision on this particular case. The gross reversal for MFI business decreased from rupees 511.72 crores in Q4 to rupees 514 crores in Q1. The SMA pool size had come down significantly and that also reflected to lower SMA 0% sequentially. We also provisioned to significantly come down in Q2 on the MFI front. Gross reversal ratio during the quarter excluding microfinance stood at 3.54% which was marginally higher than 3.35% which we had on an average in March 4 quarters put together. We expect this to improve from here on. Moving on to profitability, let me start with NII that grew at 5.1% on a Y&Y basis to rupees 4933 crores for Q1. Excluding MFI, because MFI book has been coming down, excluding MFI NII grew by about 11.8% on a Y&Y basis. The net interest margin areas for the quarter moderated by 20 more basis points to 5.71% and the decrease was I would say attributed to many components. Of course there was a faster repo which happened on the applicable book. There has been a decline in the microfinance business and the phase that we have scaled the wholesale business and also there was moderation in the investment fees as the rates came down. This was often to some extent by the reduction in the cost of funds. The decline in yield as I mentioned earlier at 20 basis point in fact would be 17 basis points if you simply annualize yields on months for both Q4 and Q1. Moving on to fee and other income for the quarter that increased sequentially by 14% from rupees 295 crores to rupees 1735 crores in Q1 of this year. The retail fee contribute most of it and that is 91% of the total fee. Again if you exclude MFI business then NII fee and other income put together grew by about 12.2% for the quarter on a YY basis. We continue to moderate on the operating expenditure front for the quarter growth has moderated to 11% on a YY basis. Sequentially OpEx declined by 1.4% in value terms. Tailings growth for the quarter was strong at rupees 4.95 crores. We also did some participation
I think the
gross 17.25 as of now last year,
and we continue
to see that declining. But broadly, we hope that
margin should to an extent sort of restore that.
For many quarters now, some individuals have 120 crore companies issue. But here, nothing is in place. I can do it in 49.5. So, do you think, are you very comfortable with everything also? Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from the line of James from IKEA KPJ. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi, good evening sir. Sir, you have seen the CATTA numbers together, which is 50% of our UIOs. If you have the numbers separately for current and repeat growth, for this quarter and maybe YOY, just to get an understanding of the growth in current and repeat growth. Yes, I could have said. So, we are only looking at the growth in CAI as well. But the CAI as a proportion is still smaller for us, right? And that's about 15% of the total CAI. But if you endeavor to increase this CATTA proportion as we want to go along. If you see, because they have been here for long, this ratio is significantly higher, about 20-25% of CATTA. And as far as the total deposits are concerned, we are around 13-14%. For us, that ratio is around 7.5-8% marginally. So, we have also been increasing in the CATTA proportion. Yeah. And I think you have to remember that we are lower actually on CAI as a percentage of what it should be. Because in the industry, generally people think CAI is half-half. But we certainly feel that we should, because we are doing effective work, reach the CAI and control growth. We believe that we should be able to, we are definitely trying to get in that number cap. Right, I was trying to understand, we are now in the last, let's say one or two quarters, a lot of banks have had CAI drastically, right? And we now have a significant advantage over peers in terms of rate. As that growing, you know, dramatically in the balances, because there was no visibility just by looking at the CATTA number in total. So, that was the idea to understand, you know, of course, if we are kind of say sacrificing on the cost, are we getting a so-called, a bit of a time focus? I mean, I think the numbers show that our growth is very strong. So, I think, as in management, I am understanding a little bit what is driving that growth number. It's a combination, it's a bank, it's a tech, it's a UI, UX, it's a very, very good model half. If you don't have the bank, the bank account is a very, very good model half. It's a very, very good. So, maybe our public, you know, presence in a different industry is good. So, there are so many things that are going well for this growth, several years of growth, which is a relative of the growth. So, we are very, very focused on this thing. But something is working, a combo is working for that. So, if I leave CAI today, the reason why, you know, the idea is that CAI more sharply and briefly is that as in name, let's say that one year goes forward, goes ahead. I mean, our entire fixed deposit balances of say about a lakh or so can be priced downwards. Okay, let's call it like 1,200 at this point. Can you imagine what a massive benefit it will be for the bank in the subsequent year in terms of entry and cleanliness and everything? So, because it is crushed downwards. So, that's how we think about CAI every day because we will see the benefit of it in subsequent years because it is just crushing it from downwards. Besides, in our hands, you can cut it any way you want. We just want to make sure that there is enough money in the bank. If you say about our bonds, you still have to pay for the deposit, not because you already financed everything. So, we paid out everything, we did money. And we still people then, many of the other borrowers. Right. No, so I was just looking at the timing of this, if you want to cut CAI and then maybe this is the time, right? I mean, CAI is by the peer banks has come down to historical low levels. And then, but the peer banks are not cutting rates, we did slower rates. CAI rates, it is a one year, one year, you know, like you have to zone of a big bank. So, everything is perfect. If you look at the rate, it is 50% of the total, and the rate is 50% more. So, what do you say, can the numbers change by 50 points and this one? Yeah, of course, the other banks can change. But 50 points? No, no, no, we don't think that. And that's happening. You don't think we will do that 100 points. Right. So, in short, you have very limited 50 points. There is a bit of a balance on it here. We have multiple banks, NDFC, big and small, saying there are some degrees of risk, there are 1,7000 payments, and they are sending some CV, some micro-finances, and other issues. But you are some entities, fully reasonably friendly, and definitely a lot of it has to do with your underwriting and your standards. But I just wanted to figure if there is a risk three or six months down the line, which may be brewing, but as a market, we are not fully aware of. No, I think I should always admit. No, I genuinely believe your concerns are valid at this point, because if you did your 50 basis chart, like the more I think you can make it around 1,000, 1,200, and this question is 2%, or 2,500, and 50 basis gives me a number, so that now I know what is your next number. Okay, now let's go to this. Now, do you think only products of the bank are taking that risk? No. Do you expect our X2 to be, you know, X cross average book impact between, could it be better than X1? You think X2, you know, like Q2 could be like probably zone, or probably X1, Q2 could be probably similar, I would say, in terms of your X. But you think Q3, X3 will be 0.5, X3 will be not gone very wrong with our numbers, you know, for the last many, many years, we modeled it all the time and keep tracking forward. We modeled it as the past. I won't benchmark say that Q3, Q4 is looking better, we don't expect it to go down again. You are concerned X2, X10, Q2, Q5 become Q5, no, we don't think so. So, we'll watch since I see that you are concerned, so we are seeing a very different number on the other side of the planet. So, don't have this conversation here because we are not saying data proves everything, you know. Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Next question is from the line of Deepak from Manganese. Please go ahead. Hi, it's a small change, but again, a decrease on the home loan as well as land. On a sequential basis, it has increased by about 40-50 basis. Could you just, if you can, why has it happened? I think the number of shares can talk about the reaction from the bank. Okay, I'm not expecting someone to say. Marginally, marginally, you know. So, yeah. I like to discuss that. I want to see the difference. So, you see mass 25, and then it's 152, and then it's 152. So, yes, exactly. So, my question is for you. On a sequential basis, also, largely in that key ENCA, if you compared the both, is there a change in the paper difference from the ENCA side, or do you think that you can, right? Because a lot of banks and a lot of NDSCs have been highlighting some sort of stress, a potential stress on ENCA. No, we definitely can't see this problem. We can't see it. We are so much in a very, very good position. But we, there's not been any material slowdown on our end to the rest. But if you think of our numbers, as I speak particularly from the ENCA, that the overall business finance book, you know, that we have holding loan, sold sale, loan to the loan, but the rest of the book is little bit, it's not growing dramatically as it is. All right, if you take a particular quarter, if you take a quarter, so you see March 25, it's 8,300, but it's 10,000, 8,300 and the 40,000. If you add them up, take your paper, we have this slide. Yeah, yeah. Give it a slide. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference call was the last question of the day. I now hand over the commercializer to happy MDNCEO for closing comments. Yeah, thank you very much for staying up and for participating with us. I wanted to stress out that we look careful, except Microsoft Finance, we were not specifically calling, whether some 25 questions, some interviews, or something come down. But broadly, we were taking a clear zone. Again, zone of the repair, data suddenly, some interviews, as we said, are in the zone. One of the colors, as you mentioned, has happened in detail.
