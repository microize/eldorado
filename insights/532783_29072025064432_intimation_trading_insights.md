Based on the insights from the earnings call transcript for LT Foods, here are some actionable trading strategies structured for various trading horizons:

**Short-Term Trading:**
- **Leverage on Revenue Growth**: Given that LT Foods reported its highest ever quarterly revenue (Rs. 2,501 crores) with a growth of 20%, consider taking a long position on the stock to capitalize on the current momentum. Monitor the stock closely for short-term price movements in response to the positive earnings sentiment.
  
- **Capitalize on Product Demand**: The organic business grew significantly, particularly in the soya milk segment (32%), indicating strong consumer demand. Traders could initiate positions as positive sentiment is likely to drive stock prices higher, especially if the market reacts favorably to continuous product innovation announcements.

**Long-Term Trading:**
- **Focus on Geographic Expansion**: LT Foods is expanding its operations in Europe and North America, with robust growth in these markets. Consider a long-term investment strategy focusing on the company's ability to penetrate these profitable markets. Strengthening ties with leading retailers in the UK suggests a positive trajectory.
  
- **Organic Market Potential**: With an ambitious plan to tap into the EU’s $45 billion organic market and the successful launch of a new facility in Rotterdam, investing in LT Foods could be part of a long-term strategy as the company positions itself to capture significant market share in healthy food options.

**Swing Trading:**
- **Profit from Margin Trends**: The EBITDA margins have slightly decreased to 12.1%, down from 12.4%. Traders could look for swing trade opportunities based on future expectations of margin recovery as the company optimizes its branding and marketing expenses—buying on dips if margins stabilize.
  
- **Monitor New Product Launches**: The introduction of new concepts like the 'biryani rice' and 'curry rice cake' can potentially create short-term spikes in stock interest. Engagement with these product lines can provide short-term trading opportunities, especially if the market responds positively.

In conclusion, LT Foods demonstrates strong potential for growth through both revenue and strategic expansion. Utilizing a mix of short, long, and swing trading strategies based on the insights from the earnings call can enable investors to maximize their trading effectiveness. Always be mindful of market trends and potential volatility when executing trades.
