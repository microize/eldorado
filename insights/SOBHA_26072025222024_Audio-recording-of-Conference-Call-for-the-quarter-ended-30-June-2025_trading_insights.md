Based on the analysis of the earnings call transcript, here are actionable trading strategies organized by time frame:

**Short-Term Trading:**
- **Actionable Insight 1:** Capitalize on short-term volatility by trading the stock around the news of upcoming project launches. The company's expectation to launch 8 million square feet in the coming year can create price movements that can be exploited through buying before announcements and selling on the rush of positive sentiment.
- **Actionable Insight 2:** Given the guidance of a 30% increase in revenue for the current fiscal year, consider going long on the stock leading up to the quarterly earnings report to potentially benefit from favorable market reactions. This may result in short-term gains if results align positively with market expectations.

**Long-Term Trading:**
- **Actionable Insight 1:** Invest in the stock for capital appreciation as the company is expanding its project portfolio and improving operational strategies. The focus on cities such as Bangalore and NCR indicates a strategic approach to investing in growth markets, setting a foundation for sustained revenue claims over the long term.
- **Actionable Insight 2:** With a plan to improve EBITDA margins and solidify market presence in high-growth areas, long-term investors might find value in accumulating shares. The projection of cash flow growth due to improved project recognition can yield significant returns over a multi-year horizon.

**Swing Trading:**
- **Actionable Insight 1:** Use the projected revenues derived from new project launches and the subsequent market performance around earnings calls as swing trading opportunities. For example, entering trades before major project announcements and exiting shortly after they are publicly confirmed can yield profits from the expected uptick in stock price.
- **Actionable Insight 2:** Monitor market sentiment around new project launches and any updates on approvals, as this could create short-term price movements. Traders may want to buy on pullbacks following positive news and sell within a defined range to take advantage of price fluctuations typically seen during project rollouts.

These strategies leverage insights from the transcript concerning growth expectations and operational developments that could influence market behavior for the stock in question.
